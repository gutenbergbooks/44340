<p class="block">This was Gérôme's first picture. It was exhibited at the Salon
of 1847, and achieved a brilliant success. Théophile Gautier, who
was a critic hard to please, bestowed upon it some enviable praise.
In later years the artist found much to censure in his early work;
but the public, less severely critical, admired the graceful nudity of
the young forms and the combative ardour of the two adversaries.</p>

INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Gérôme</span> has his allotted place among the
illustrious French painters of the Nineteenth
Century. He achieved success, honours,
official recognition; and he deserved them, if not
for the compelling personality of his temperament,
at least for his assiduous industry, his<span class="page"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
accurate, methodical, and picturesque way of
seeing people and things, and the amazing and
fertile variety both of his choice and his interpretation
of subjects.</p>

<p>He was a pupil of Paul Delaroche and seems
to have inherited the latter's adroitness in seizing
upon the one salient and emotional detail
in a composition. Like that historian-painter
of the <cite>Death of the Duc de Guise</cite>, Gérôme excelled
in always giving a dramatic stage setting to
the persons and the events which he knew how
to conjure up with such learned and scrupulous
care.</p>

<p>In spite of his versatility, and notwithstanding
that many a vast canvas has demonstrated
his ingenious and resourceful talent, he takes
his place beside Meissonier because of the extreme
importance that he attached to accuracy
and precise effects.</p>

  <div class="caption">
  <p>PLATE II.&mdash;RECEPTION OF THE SIAMESE AMBASSADORS</p>

  <p>(In the Museum at Versailles)</p>

<p class="block">This picture possesses a curious interest because it shows
in what a picturesque manner Gérôme could execute a painting
officially ordered. He received the commission in 1865, through
the Imperial Household. He has rendered with much felicity all
the pompous and highly coloured aspect of the scene, very effective
in the sumptuous setting of the Salle des Fêtes at Fontainebleau.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Although it is some years since he passed
away, Gérôme has left behind him living memories
among his friends and pupils, many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
whom have in their turn become masters. Both
as man and as artist he was and still continues
to be profoundly regretted, independently of all
divergences of opinion, method, and temperament.</p>

<p>A master of oriental lore, a curious and subtle
antiquarian, a chronicler of ancient and modern
life, rigorous at times, but more often distinguished
for his charm and delicacy,&mdash;such is
Gérôme as he has revealed himself to us through
the medium of his abundant works.</p>

<p>Whether he paints us the men of the Desert
and the almas of Egypt, or shows us the gladiators
of the Circus, the death of Caesar, the leisure
hours of Frederick II, the dreams of a Bonaparte,
or takes us to the <cite>Winter Duel in the
Bois de Boulogne after the Masked Ball</cite>, a
picture that achieved much popularity, Gérôme
never fails to catch and hold attention by startling
contrasts of colour combined with a fine
accuracy of line work.</p>

<p>But what matter the means through which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
an effect is sought if they prove successful
both in the general impression produced by the
work as a whole and in the charm of the separate
details,&mdash;in other words, if the result justifies
the effort?</p>

<p>Effort, in Gérôme's case, meant literally a
valiant and noble persistence. He was ceaselessly
in search of something new. In spite of
assured fame, he never repainted the same subject.
During the later years of his life, his ambition
was to be at the same time an illustrious
painter and a sculptor of recognized merit; and
in this he succeeded. His attempt to revive,
after a fashion of his own, the precious lost art
of antique sculpture, although greeted with a
wide divergence of opinions, remains a noteworthy
achievement.</p>

<p>On the eve of his eightieth year and abrupt
decease, Gérôme still laboured with the ardour
and the splendid faith of youth. He sets an
encouraging example, as fine and as stimulating
as the best of his splendid pictures.</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="THE_LIFE_OF_GEROME" id="THE_LIFE_OF_GEROME">THE LIFE OF GÉRÔME</a><span class="pageno"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></h2>


<p>Jean-Léon Gérôme was born at Vesoul on
May 11, 1824. Throughout his life he retained a
slight trace of the Franche-Compté accent, which
gave a keener relish to his witty anecdotes and
piquant retorts.</p>

<p>He belonged to a family holding an honoured
place among the bourgeoisie. His excellent
biographer, M. Moreau-Vauthier, relates that his
grandfather was on the point of taking orders
when the Revolution broke out. His father was
a watchmaker and goldsmith at Vesoul. As a
child, he himself was in delicate health.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he proved himself a good student
at the college in the city of his birth. While
there he studied both Greek and Latin. His
instructor in drawing, Cariage, having noticed
his early efforts, gave him much good advice
and encouragement.</p>

<p>At the age of fourteen, he copied a picture
by Decamps, which had found its way to Vesoul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
from Paris. The story goes that his father forthwith
favoured the idea that he should take up
the vocation of an artist. There is no use in
exaggerating. As a matter of fact, his family
dreaded the hardships of so hazardous a career.
But, upon receiving his bachelor's degree at the
age of sixteen, a degree which at that epoch
was by no means common, he obtained permission
to go to the capital and pursue his studies
under the auspices of Paul Delaroche, to whom
he was provided with a letter of introduction.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to picture the young man setting
forth alone by <em>diligence</em> and applying himself
bravely to the task of acquiring talent and
renown.</p>

<p>He was most faithful in his attendance at
the studio of Delaroche, who, being the son-in-law
of Horace Vernet, possessed at that time
not only a wide reputation as professor, but also
an enormous influence both at the École des
Beaux-Arts and at the court of Louis-Philippe.</p>

<p>Delaroche, who has aptly been called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Casimir Delavigne of painting, a romanticist who
stopped short of being a revolutionary, parted
company with the cold traditionalists of the older
school in the profound importance that he attached
to accuracy and to the truth and interest
of movement.</p>

<p>Gérôme was destined to draw his inspiration
from analogous principles. While interesting
himself profoundly in costumes, in surroundings,
in local colour, he always avoided excess and
maintained an almost classic restraint even in
the most modern of his fantasies.</p>

<p>Delaroche's pupils were a lively set. Gérôme
found life pleasant in the studio where Cham
amused himself by passing himself off upon
strangers as "the patron," and where his comrades
were such men as Alfred Arago, Hébert,
Hamon, Jalabert, Landelle, Picou, and Yvon.</p>

<p>He won their regard by his flow of spirits
and his caustic humour. At this period he supported
himself by copying paintings and making
drawings for the newspapers; but, although a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
small monthly income of a hundred francs assured
him comparative security, he was uneasy.
Although only eighteen, the young man was
impatient to show what he could do. He was
seeking his path.</p>

<p>He took his first step towards finding it when
he accompanied his teacher to Italy after the
latter had closed his studio. He remained there
for an entire year.</p>

<p>Upon his return, he studied for a time under
Gleyre, after which he worked for some months
on Delaroche's <cite>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps</cite>.</p>

<p>In 1847, Gérôme made his début at the Salon
with a veritable master-stroke. At an exposition
where Delacroix's <cite>Shipwrecked Bark</cite> and Couture's
<cite>Roman Orgy</cite> monopolized the public gaze,
the young artist attracted keen attention by his
<cite>Young Greeks Engaged in Cock Fighting</cite>. Théophile
Gautier enthusiastically proclaimed the
merits of this work, which brought Gérôme much
valued praise and some influential supporters.</p>

<p>We shall revert again to this significant canvas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
which since 1874 has hung in the Luxembourg
Museum, and with which the artist, when
he later attained full mastery of his art, found all
manner of fault.</p>

<p>The first meeting between this painter of
twenty-three, upon whom renown had just begun
to smile, and Gautier, magnanimous prince of
criticism and poetry, took place under circumstances
that deserve to be recorded.</p>

<p>Gérôme was betaking himself to the offices of
the <cite>Artiste</cite>, at that time presided over by Arsène
Houssaye; in his hand he held a line drawing
of his own recent idyll of classic times. On the
staircase he encountered Gautier who had paused
there, and who began to talk to him in glowing
terms of the Salon and especially of a painting
by a newcomer, named Gérôme.</p>

<p>"But that is I, myself!" cried the young man
with keen emotion, and he showed his drawing
to the author of <cite>Enamels and Cameos</cite>.</p>

<p>Continuing to draw his inspiration from antiquity,
he set to work with a stouter heart, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
a studio on the Rue de Fleurus, which he shared
with Hamon and Picou, associating with artists
and with musicians such as Lalo and Membrée.</p>

<p>His labours were twice interrupted: first, by
an attack of typhoid fever, through which his
mother came to nurse him; and secondly, by the
Revolution of 1848 when, in compliance with
the expressed desire of his comrades, he was
appointed adjutant major of the National Guards.</p>

<p>It was about this same period that he received a
first class medal and found himself well advanced
upon the road to fame.</p>

<p>"I have always had the nomadic instinct,"
Gérôme used to declare, and complacently questioned
whether he did not have a strain of gypsy
blood among his ancestors. In his notes and
souvenirs, which he entrusted to his relative and
friend, the painter Timbal, he confesses, along
with his various artistic scruples, his passionate
love of travel.</p>

  <p>PLATE III.&mdash;ANACREON WITH BACCHUS AND CUPID</p>

  <p>(In the Museum at Toulouse)</p>

<p class="block">Gérôme had a magic brush that permitted him to undertake all
types of painting with the same facility. This is how he so often
happened to treat subjects taken from antiquity and was able to
render them in all their classic beauty. It is not without interest
to compare him, in this style of painting, with Nicholas Poussin,
whom he admired, and with Puvis de Chavannes, whose method
he execrated.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>He was haunted by a longing to visit Greece,
and more especially the Orient, with its marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
skies, its resplendent colours, its barbaric
and motley races of men.</p>

<p>In 1853, in the company of a number of friends,
he traversed Germany and Hungary, planning a
lengthy visit to Constantinople. Owing to the
war, he was forced to cut short his trip at
Galatz. But he brought back a collection of
energetic and striking sketches of Russian soldiers,
which later served good purpose in his
<cite>Recreation in Camp, Souvenir of Moldavia</cite>. And
in like manner, in all his distant journeyings,
he invariably showed the same eagerness to seize
and transcribe his original documents, content
to let them speak for themselves, without his
having to distort them to fit the special purpose
that he had in view.</p>

<p>This painting found a place in the exposition
of 1855, together with <cite>The Age of Augustus</cite>, a notable
achievement in which Gérôme revealed the
measure, if not of his true personality, at least
of his lofty conscience and his integrity as an
artist enamoured of accuracy and truth, even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
the imaginary element inseparable from this type
of allegorical apotheosis. Notwithstanding a few
dissenting opinions, these two works were judged
at their true value, and Gérôme received the cross
of the Legion of Honour.</p>

<p>At this time he was scarcely more than thirty
years old. A most brilliant career henceforth lay
open before him.</p>

<p>Gérôme remains, beyond question, the unrivalled
painter of Egypt, whose aspects, enchanting
and sinister alike, he has reproduced in a
series of pictures of finished workmanship and
vibrant colouring.</p>

<p>It was in 1856 that, together with a few
friends, among others Bartholdi, then twenty-two
years old, he undertook his long tour through
Egypt. To-day, one can go to Cairo or up the
Nile as casually as to Nice or Italy and with
almost as little trouble. In those days it was
not a question of a simple excursion, of which
any and every amateur tourist would be capable,
but of a veritable expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>Unforeseen adventures appealed to Gérôme,
for he was brave, energetic, and eager for
new sensations. M. Frédéric Masson, the eminent
historian, who was one of his companions
through the desert, has since shown him to
us, in a series of graphic recollections, as perpetually
on his feet, indefatigable, ready to
endure any and every vicissitude for the sake
of sketching a site or a silhouette.</p>

<p>His stay in Egypt was for Gérôme a
period of enchantment. He has left, in regard
to it, some hasty but expressive notes. He
passed four months on the Nile, well filled
months, consecrated to fishing, hunting, and
painting, all the way from Diametta to Philae.
He remained the four succeeding months at Cairo,
in an old dwelling that Suliman Pasha rented
to the young Frenchmen. "Happy epoch!" wrote
the painter, "Care-free, full of hope, and with
the future before us. The sky was blue."</p>

<p>He returned to Paris with an ample harvest
of sketches, a supply of curious, novel, and striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
themes to work up. M. Moreau-Vauthier
shows him to us at that period of his existence,
full of unflagging energy and pleasant enthusiasm,
in the company of Brion, Lambert, Schutzenberger,
and Toulmouche,&mdash;not to forget his
monkey Jacques, who took his place at the family
table arrayed in coat and white cravat, but would
slink away and hide himself in shame when,
as a punishment for some misdeed, they decked
him out as a ragpicker.</p>

<p>What jolly parties were held in that "Tea
Chest," in which Gérôme then had his studio,
Rue de Notre-Dame-des-Champs! It was the
scene of many a festival, entertainment, and joyous
puppet show, attended by spectators such
as Rachel (whose portrait Gérôme painted in
1861), her sister, George Sand, Baudry, Cabanel,
Hébert, and others.</p>

<p>This was, nevertheless, an epoch of prolific
work and constant research. Gérôme passed
ceaselessly from one type of painting to another;
one might say that he rested from his exotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
landscapes by evoking, with an ever new lavishness
of detail, curious or affecting scenes from
Greek and Roman antiquity.</p>

<p>Thus rewards and successes multiplied, and
he experienced all the joys of triumph. Already
honorary member of the Academy of Besançon,
he was appointed professor at the École des
Beaux-Arts in 1863, and in 1865, member of the
Institut, where he succeeded Heim.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he fought a duel with revolvers
and was gravely wounded. His mother hastened
once again to his bedside and saved his life a
second time. Since the ball had passed through
his right arm, complications affecting his hand
were feared. The artist declared that if necessary
he would learn to paint with his left. No
sooner was he cured than off he started again,
bound for Egypt, whence he passed to Arabia
and, more venturesome than ever, continued on
his way, as one of his biographers phrased it,
"making sketches clear to the summit of Mt. Sinai."</p>

<p>He was destined to make still other journeys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
notably that of 1868 in company of Messrs.
Bonnet, Frédéric Masson, and Lenoir; and his
companions paid tribute to his unfailing spirits
and his powers of endurance. But at the age of
forty he married. The bride was Mlle. Goupil,
daughter of the well-known picture dealer.</p>

<p>He was a thorough man of the world and a
favoured guest of the Duc d'Aumale, who appreciated
his ready wit and bought his <cite>After
the Masquerade</cite> for the sum of 20,000 francs. In
1865 he received from the Beaux-Arts and the
Imperial Household an order for <cite>The Reception
of the Siamese Ambassadors at Fontainebleau</cite>.</p>

<p>Gérôme was also numbered among Compiègne's
habitual visitors, along with Berlioz,
Gustave Doré, Guillaume, Merimée, Viollet-le-Duc,
and others. M. Moreau-Vauthier, who
with pious zeal has collected the more interesting
anecdotes of his life, relates that he had a
special gift for organizing charades: he was
scene setter and costumer. At Fontainebleau,
he took the Empress out alone in a row-boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>Surrounded by devoted friends, such as Augier,
Charles Blanc, Dumas, Clery, his brother-in-law,
Frémiet, Gérôme continued his laborious
and tranquil life in his vast atelier on the Boulevard
de Clichy.</p>

<p>His days were passed in drawing and painting
in his canvases. Towards the end of the
afternoon he would mount his horse and take a
turn in the Bois. He exhibited annually up to
the year of the war. After that, he lived in a
sort of retirement until 1874, when, after a trip
to Algeria with G. Boulanger and Poilpot, he
won a medal of honour. <cite>A Collaboration</cite>, <cite>Rex
Tibicen</cite> (The King Flutist), and <cite>His Gray Eminence</cite>,
exhibited simultaneously, revealed him in
full possession of his ingenious and many-sided
art.</p>

<p>New and resounding triumphs awaited him
at the Exposition Universelle of 1878, where he
first revealed himself as a sculptor. As a matter
of fact, he had for a long time amused himself
at modelling in clay. He used to go to Frémiet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
studio to do his modelling, and Frémiet, by way
of exchange, would come to paint in his. His
two groups, <cite>Gladiators</cite> and <cite>Anacreon, Bacchus
and Cupid</cite>, won him a second class medal to take
its place beside the medal of honour he had previously
received for his paintings. That same
year, at the age of fifty-four, he was raised to the
rank of Commander. Cham expressed the joy of
all his friends by writing to him wittily: "I follow
the example of your ribbon, I fall upon your neck."</p>

<p>He was yet to gain still further honours: a
first class medal as sculptor, in 1881; to be declared
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hors Concours</i> (Not entered for Competition)
at the Expositions of 1889 and 1900; and to
be named Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour.</p>

<p>From 1880 onward, excepting for a few flying
visits to Spain and Italy, Gérôme lived at his
hotel in Paris, where he kept up a rather lavish
establishment, including horses and dogs, up to
the time of the successive deaths of his father
and his son. It was the latter for whose tomb
he carved a touching figure of <cite>Grief</cite>.</p>

  <p>PLATE IV.&mdash;POLLICE VERSO</p>

  <p>(In a Private Collection, United States)</p>

<p class="block">The scenes from Roman antiquity repeatedly appealed to
Gérôme's talent, notably in the case of the Games of the Circus,
the dramatic value and brilliant colour of which he fully appreciated.
In <cite>Pollice Verso</cite>, he shows us the victorious gladiator, who, in order
to know whether or not he is to despatch his adversary, turns a
questioning glance towards the Vestals, who invert their thumbs,
decreeing death for the vanquished and gasping opponent.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>His studio at Bougival held him for many a
long day, while the season lasted. While there,
he worked with extraordinary assiduity, barely
giving himself time enough to appear among his
guests and hastily swallow a few mouthfuls of
the mid-day meal. He owned at one time another
country house at Coulevon, near Vesoul, but this
he sold to one of his former pupils, Muenier. He
remained none the less the chief pride of his
native town, where, even during the artist's life,
there was a street bearing the name of Gérôme.</p>

<p>His favourite summering place, however, was
in the heart of Normandy at Saint-Martin, near
to Pont-Lévêque, where he possessed a delightful
property.</p>

<p>"He is a charming man, of rare integrity and
fascination. Very simple, too, like all men of
real power, who need not exert themselves in
order to prove their strength." It is after this
fashion that M. Jules Claretie sums him up in
his exquisite study of <cite>Contemporary Painters and
Sculptors</cite>. M. Frédéric Masson, his faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
friend, has drawn the following excellent portrait
of Gérôme: "A head firmly set upon a long neck,
features vigorously modelled in acute angles,
sunken cheeks, complexion bronzed, eyes brilliant
and strangely black, moustache obstinate
and bristling, hair almost kinky, and sprouting
in massive clumps, &hellip; a straight nose set
in a lean face, &hellip; figure exceedingly slender
and flexible, waist medium, but well modelled."</p>

<p>Such he appears in his painting of himself as
a sculptor in his studio, absorbed, in his alert
and perennially youthful old age, by his new
task of making polychrome statues. M. Aimé
Morot, his son-in-law, has shown him to us in
his intimate life, simple, natural, and at one and
the same time alert and caustic. We find him
also thoroughly alive in the fine bust by Carpeaux
and in the medal by Chaplain, now in
the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>M. Dagnan-Bouveret saw him under another
aspect. In the portrait he has given us, we
have the master authoritatively proclaiming his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
convictions. This distinguished artist, by the
way, was formerly a pupil of Gérôme's. One
day when he was complimenting the latter upon
his method of teaching, Gérôme replied, in his
loud, assertive voice: "When I undertake to do
a thing, I do it to the very end. I am a man
with a sense of duty."</p>

<p>As professor at the École des Beaux-Arts he
continued to fulfil his duty for a period of forty
years. While conducting his classes he showed
himself grave and stern, even sardonic when so
inclined. In front of a canvas too thickly coated,
he would exclaim: "The paint shop man will
be pleased"; or perhaps he would move around
to get a side view and then play upon his words,
saying: "How that picture stands out!"</p>

<p>He had a good many foreigners in his studio,
Spaniards such as La Gandara, Americans like
Bridgman and Harrison, and Russians such as
the celebrated and courageous Verestschagen
who, according to M. Léon Coutil, declared, in
speaking of Gérôme, "Next to my dear Skobelof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
he is the most resolute man that I have ever
met."</p>

<p>Gérôme was frank and unreserved in his
opinions. Having become, so to speak, the official
representative of French painting, he was
exposed to repeated attacks. He did not hesitate
to flout unmercifully and to pursue with a veritable
hatred such artists as had adopted formulas
opposed to his own,&mdash;and among them some of
the biggest and the ones least open to discussion.
M. Besnard, who was not a pupil of his, nevertheless
owed him his Prix de Rome.</p>

<p>Many were the circumstances under which
he showed his energetic firmness; for example,
when the Prince de la Moskowa wished to fix a
quarrel on him and prevent him from exhibiting
<cite>The Death of Mareschal Ney</cite>, he evoked this noble
declaration from Gérôme: "The painter has his
rights as much as the historian."</p>

  <div class="caption">
  <p>PLATE V.&mdash;THE PRISONER</p>

  <p>(In the Museum of Nantes)</p>

<p class="block">Gérôme had travelled extensively in the East, for he loved its
vigorous colouring and picturesque customs. Here is a scene
glimpsed from the banks of the Nile, and he has transcribed it in this
superb picture, vibrant with colour and harmonious in composition.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>And when a prominent politician criticised
the official curriculum without proposing anything
to take its place, it was, according to M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Moreau-Vauthier, again Gérôme who replied:
"Gentlemen, it is easier to be an incendiary than
a fireman!"</p>

<p>This firmness, however, did not prevent him,
so this same biographer points out, from being
sensitive to such a degree that he could not
bear to watch a cat of Frémiet's preparing to
devour a nest of sparrows. He used to bring
champagne and dainty viands as presents to his
pupils. His humour, so M. Moreau-Vauthier goes
on to say, served as a mask to hide his sentiment.
Poilpot, to whom Gérôme was destined
later to give useful counsels for his panorama
of Reischoffen, was working prior to 1870 in his
studio. One day he went to show him some
drawings. His master, having looked him over,
inquired: "So, then, you have no shirt?" "No,
patron," he replied, "I never wear any." The
next day, Poilpot received a commission for a
copy of an official portrait of Napoleon III,
together with an advance payment of 600 francs.
This pretty anecdote does as much honour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the pride of the one as to the delicacy of the
other.</p>

<p>Gérôme sincerely loved the youth, the fantasy,
the gaiety of France, and more especially
of Paris. One perceives it in reading the sparkling
preface which he wrote for M. Miguel
Zamacoïs' <cite>Articles of Paris</cite>, blithely illustrated by
M. Guillaume. He was not too proud to appear
at costume balls, nor to continue to take an interest
in them even after he had ceased to attend
them. He once put his name to a picturesque
sign for a doll shop in the "Old Paris" exhibit at
the Exposition. For an advertisement contest he
painted a dog wearing a monocle, with this amusing
inscription and play on words, "<i>O pti cien</i>"
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">0 petit chien</i>, i.e., O little dog). He amused
himself by sending to a toy competition, organized
by the prefect of police, a little Pompeiian saleswoman
holding a basket of various toys, and a
diminutive police officer brandishing a white club.</p>

<p>Gérôme had always wished for a sudden and
brusque death, "without physic and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
night-cap." He was spared both physical and
moral decline. At the age of seventy-nine
he climbed the stairs, four steps at a time, and
sprang upon moving omnibuses running. He
died suddenly of a cerebral congestion, on his
return from a dinner which he had attended
together with his colleagues of the Institut,
January 10, 1904.</p>



<hr />


<h2 class="no-break"><a name="THE_ARTISTS_WORK" id="THE_ARTISTS_WORK">THE ARTIST'S WORK</a></h2>


<p>It is difficult to enumerate in detail all the
works of Gérôme, whose originality and energy
were inexhaustible. Only a short time before his
death he declared that with the help of the
sketches contained in his cupboards he had
material enough to keep him busy for twenty-five
years longer.</p>

<p>Instead of attempting to draw up a chronological
list of his paintings, which would be only
approximately correct, even if limited to the more
important, it is more profitable to study this conscientious
artist under his principal aspects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>Although he made some talented attempts,
Gérôme neither was nor wished to be a portrait
painter, any more than a painter of modern life.
He had, however, as has been pointed out, all the
necessary qualities for this type which demands
so much precision and assurance. In <cite>The Emperor
Napoleon III Receiving the Siamese Ambassadors
at the Palace of Fontainebleau</cite>, now in the
museum at Versailles, there are eighty portraits.
The artist has represented himself, side by side
with Meissonier, and the story is told that a certain
general accorded him a sitting of only ten
minutes.</p>

<p>Besides the large and somewhat sombre portrait
of Rachel, which adorns the Stairway of
Artists at the Comédie-Française, and which was
painted from existing likenesses and from memory,
there is scarcely anything else to cite than
the portrait of his brother while a student in the
Polytechnic School, a <cite>Head of a Woman</cite> (1853,
at the museum of Nantes), those of M. Leblond,
at Vesoul, mentioned by M. Guillaumin, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
M. A. T. (1864), of Cléry, the great lawyer, and of
Charles Garnier, the celebrated architect of the
Opéra.</p>

<p>As a sculptor, Gérôme has left some admirable
busts, among others those of Mme. Sarah Bernhardt,
bequeathed to the National Museum, of
<cite>General Cambriels</cite>, of <cite>Henri Lavoix</cite>, the <cite>Monument
of Paul Baudry</cite> destined for La Roche-sur-Yon,
and, most important of all, the <cite>Equestrian
Statue of the Duc d'Aumale</cite>, which is now to be
seen at Chantilly, and the model for which is
at the museum of Besançon.</p>

<p>Gérôme had a sincere and profound love for
antiquity; with him it was not the enjoyment
of a contemplative mind, a tranquil amateur art,
but that of an historian, an archaeologist coupled
with the instinct of a dramatist, a psychologue,
let us say, who is eager to discover, in any scene
whatever, in the graceful or violent gestures of
such and such personages of bygone days,
some general application. He was certainly
most anxious to suggest interesting or amusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
parallels to modern life, for, in spite of the dissimilarity
of the settings, the tinsels, the decorations,
over which the artist laboured with an
almost devout care of minute detail, human
nature to-day is always more or less close to
the human nature of Greece or Rome.</p>

<p>"Exhibit that picture, it will bring you honour,"
said Paul Delaroche to his pupil, who had shown
him, with much misgiving, the <cite>Young Greeks
Occupied in Cock Fighting</cite>. "It shows originality
and style." And that was his first success (1847).
The grace of the young figures won much admiration.
Planche praised the harmony of the composition
as a whole. As to Théophile Gautier,
he showed himself, as we have already said,
highly enthusiastic; he declared that the features
of the boy were drawn with extreme subtlety.
"As to the cocks," he added, "they are true
prodigies of drawing, animation, and colour;
neither Snyders, nor Woenic, nor Oudry, nor
Desportes, nor Rousseau, nor any of the known
animal painters have attained, after twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
of labour, the perfection which M. Gérôme has
reached at the first attempt." Let us note immediately
that Gérôme was, as a matter of fact,
a very great painter of animals. His dogs, his
horses, and his lions are the work of a masterly
observer.</p>

<p>Closely following upon the <cite>Cock Fight</cite>, we
must recall <cite>Anacreon with Bacchus and Cupid</cite>
(1848, Toulouse Museum) which Gérôme himself
characterized as a "lifeless picture," and which
nevertheless earned him a second class medal.
Later on he was destined to treat this same subject
in marble (Salon of 1881). The polished and
somewhat affected grace of <cite>Anacreon</cite> must have
especially pleased the painter, because in 1889 he
produced a whole series of compositions of delicious
daintiness, entitled <cite>Cupid Tipsy</cite>. On the
same order of ideas, mention must be made of
<cite>Bacchus and Cupid Intoxicated</cite> (1850, Bordeaux
Museum), and in addition to these, under the
head of what may be called his Hellenic canvases,&mdash;in
which he succeeded in conjuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
up with magic skill the splendours and graces
of that immortal mother of letters and arts,
Greece beloved by the gods,&mdash;the following
pictures, <cite>The Idyll</cite> (1853), full of charm and
solid erudition; <cite>The Greek Interior</cite> (1856), of sure
and penetrating art; <cite>King Candaules</cite> (1859), in
which the sumptuous beauty of Nyssia illumines
the bed-chamber of a Heraclid, 700 years B.C.,
and in which the interest of the picturesque
anecdote is enhanced by the artist's marvellous
documentary knowledge.</p>

<p>In the same group must be mentioned <cite>Phryne
before the Tribunal</cite> (1861, reëxhibited in 1867),
of charming subtlety, but with a little too much
emphasis, perhaps, on the irony of its psychology;
and, of course, <cite>Socrates Seeking Alcibiades
at the House of Aspasia</cite>, analogous in inspiration,
and, as it happens, belonging to the same year;
and lastly <cite>Daphnis and Chloe</cite> (1898).</p>

  <p>PLATE VI.&mdash;THE LAST PRAYER</p>

  <p>(In a Private Collection, United States)</p>

<p class="block">The amphitheatre is filled to overflowing with the crowd that has
gathered to witness the martyrdom of the Christians. Around the
vast circle, unhappy victims agonize upon the cross. In one
corner of the arena, a group of men and women, condemned to die,
confess their new faith in an ardent prayer, while from the opened
subterraneous passage the ravenous beasts are advancing upon
their human prey.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Italy also, with all her memories, furnished
Gérôme with scenes of striking contrast, evoked
from the vanished past, spectacles at once sumptuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
and barbaric. He caught this atmosphere
with rare felicity. <cite>Paestum</cite> (1851) commands attention
because of its group of buffaloes, which
the Goncourts praised for "their ponderous
weight of head, the solidity of their huge bulk,
the grouping of their attitudes, the shagginess
of their coats, the prevailing sense of grateful
coolness."</p>

<p>It is necessary to assign a place apart, in this
series, for the <cite>Augustan Age, Birth of Christ</cite>
(1855, Amiens Museum). In his own private
opinion, confided to his cousin Timbal, Gérôme
held that this enormous composition, measuring
ten metres in length by seven in height,
lacked inventiveness and originality. It is true
that the artist's personality is not clearly revealed
in this picture, which is a sort of vast commentary
on a phrase by Bossuet, and indisputably
draws its inspiration from the <cite>Apotheosis of
Homer</cite> by Ingres. Nevertheless, no one can dispute
its noble qualities, and to borrow a phrase
from Théophile Gautier, its "high philosophic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
significance." Beside Augustus Caesar deified
appears Rome, in the form of a woman, helmeted,
armed with a buckler, and clad in a red
chlamys; then Tiberius, standing on the right,
then statesmen and poets, Caesar, Cleopatra,
Anthony, Brutus, and Cassius grouped together;
lastly the throng of all nations on their knees,
admirably rendered. In the centre, relatively
unimportant in this immense assemblage, are the
Virgin Mary, the Infant Jesus, and St. Joseph,
treated in a curious fashion, modelled on the
manner of Giotto. "It is the chief ornament of
the Amiens Museum," Gérôme would say jestingly;
for he had largely lost respect for this
prolonged and important effort which represented
two years' work of a serious and diligent
student of history.</p>

<p>The two flawless masterpieces of Gérôme, the
eloquent interpreter of ancient Rome, are unquestionably
his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave Caesar, Morituri te Salutant</cite>
(1859), purchased by Mathews, in which, in the
presence of a bloated, overfed Vitellius, sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
pacifically in his imperial box, not far from the
white Vestals, crowned with verbena, gladiators
are fighting and dying in the circus, and <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pollice
Verso</cite> (1874) in which these same gladiators are
represented, no longer as Roman soldiers, but
in the exact costume that they wear at the
moment when the Emperor and the crowd,
ravenous for carnage, turn down their thumbs
as signal for the death stroke. This work, published
by Goupil, did not appear at the Salon.
We must cite further <cite>Gaius Maximus</cite>, the <cite>Chariot
Race</cite>, which aroused legitimate enthusiasm in
America; The <cite>Wild Beasts Entering the Arena</cite>
(1902) and we must not forget that Gérôme also
expended his energy as a sculptor upon these
same attractive gladiatorial figures.</p>

<p>Striking and pathetic contrast is also earnestly
striven for and strongly rendered in <cite>The Death
of Caesar</cite> (1859, 1867). One almost needs to be an
incomparable "stage manager" in order to show
the body of Caesar after this fashion, in the
foreground, in the chamber deserted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Senators; one Conscript Father, as a touch of
satire, has fallen asleep. The effect is powerful,
even though it has been sought for with too
obvious care. Undoubtedly Nadar had the laugh
on his side when he compared the body of
Caesar to a bundle of linen and called the picture
"The Day of the Washerwoman." Gérôme
appreciated the humour of this pleasantry. It
is equally true that Baudelaire applauded the
picture, exclaiming: "Certainly this time M.
Gérôme's imagination has outdone itself; it
passed through a fortunate crisis when it conceived
of Caesar alone, stretched upon the
ground before his overturned throne &hellip; this
terrible epitome tells everything."</p>

<p>The clever erudition of the painter, who had
already revealed himself as an adherent of the
so-called group of "Pompeiians," in the <cite>Gyneceum</cite>
(1850),&mdash;in which we perceive a group of
nude women in the court of a house in Herculaneum,&mdash;asserts
itself once more, coupled with
an incisive touch of epigram in <cite>Two Augurs Unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
to Look at Each Other Without Laughing</cite>,
and similarly in the <cite>Cave Canem</cite>, now at Vesoul
(in front of a Roman house a slave is playing
the role of watch dog), in the <cite>Sale of Slaves at
Rome</cite> (1884), etc.</p>

<p>A similar ingenuity, with greater amplitude,
constitutes the charm and the surprise of <cite>Cleopatra
and Caesar</cite> (1886). Cleopatra has had herself
brought into Caesar's cabinet in the palace
at Alexandria, concealed in a bundle of clothing.
"Her appearance there," said Maxime du Camp,
who also praised the interest of the accessories,
treated with exquisite care, "is perfectly chaste, in
spite of her nudity." All the details are executed
with a masterly command of picturesqueness
and accuracy.</p>

<p>As a religious painter Gérôme has to his
credit the <cite>Virgin, Infant Jesus, and St. John</cite> (1848),
a youthful work imitated from Perugino, a <cite>St.
George</cite>, in the church of Saint-Georges at Vesoul,
a <cite>St. Martin Cutting his Mantle</cite>, in the ancient
refectory of Saint-Martin-des-Champs, a <cite>Death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
of St. Jerome</cite> (1878) at Saint-Séverin, a <cite>Moses on
Mt. Sinai</cite>, and <cite>The Plague at Marsailles</cite>, and, most
important of all, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Golgotha Consummatum Est</cite>, intensely
lugubrious and symbolic in aspect, with
Christ and the two thieves appearing, through the
desolate atmosphere, like writhing shadows on
the cross. This conception cost the author a violent
diatribe from Veuillot, while Edmund About,
although making certain reservations, wrote on
the other side: "The entire sum of qualities that
are distinctive of M. Gérôme will be found in
this picture."</p>

<p>As a painter of exotic life Gérôme remains an
observer of the highest order. If he has not
wholly revealed Italy to us in his <cite>Guardians of
the Herd</cite> and his <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pifferari</cite> (1855, 1857), he has at
least done so in the case of Egypt, still deeply
impregnated with an ancient and splendid civilization,
naïve and at the same time venerable,
Egypt before the advent of tourists, a luminous
land where the Nile and the Desert reign supreme,
a land of magnificence and of savagery. Landscapes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
of this Egypt of poetic mystery, and of
Palestine as well, childish or perverse <i>almas</i>,
rude Albanian Chiefs, Turbaned Turks,&mdash;one
never wearies of these decorative effects, these
clear visions, these scenes of animation, whether
violent or delicate, the people, the vegetation, the
fabrics, all resplendent under the marvellous sky
of the Orient.</p>

<p>In the company of this intrepid, venturesome
and observant traveller, we witness the passage
of <cite>Egyptian Recruits Crossing the Desert</cite>, we are
present at <cite>Prayers in the House of an Albanian
Chief</cite>, we pause in the <cite>Plain of Thebes</cite>, not far
from <cite>Memmon and Sesostris</cite>, and we watch the
<cite>Camels at the Drinking Trough</cite>, so admirably
realized. Gérôme, who had a gift for finding
the right and pleasing phrase, gave this rather
neat definition of a camel: "The Ship of the Sea
of Sand."</p>

<p>Similarly, the <cite>Egyptian Straw-chopper</cite> (1861,
again exhibited in 1867, and purchased by M.
Werlé) symbolizes, simply yet forcefully, agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Egypt, and all the varied shadings of
her pastoral poetry. Then again, there is <cite>The
Prisoner</cite> (1863), in which a boat is making its
way along the vast and pacific Nile. Two negro
oarsmen, the master, a bashibazouk, are in the
prow; and in the stern, beside a buffoon, who
apparently derides him, while twanging the
strings of a guitar, the prisoner lies cross-wise,
fast bound, and abandons himself to his cruel
destiny. There, in a setting of enchanted beauty,
we have the chief actors in this original drama,
in which dream and reality are blended.</p>

<p>What a horde of types, some of them bizarre,
others simply comic! There are, taking them as
they come, a <cite>Turkish Butcher in Jerusalem</cite> (1863),
<cite>The Alma</cite> (Professional Singing Girl&mdash;1864), <cite>The
Slaves in the Market Place</cite>, <cite>The Clothing Merchant
at Cairo</cite>, <cite>The Albanians Playing Chess</cite>
(1867), The <cite>Itinerant Merchant at Cairo</cite> (1869).
Then there is the <cite>Promenade of the Harem</cite>, and
still others, the <cite>Santon</cite> (Turkish Monk) <cite>at the
Door of the Mosque</cite> and <cite>Women at the Bath</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
(1876), the <cite>Arab and his Courser</cite> and <cite>The Return

  <p>PLATE VII.&mdash;THE VENDOR OF RUGS</p>

  <p>(In a Private Collection, United States)</p>

<p class="block">From his numerous journeys to the East, Gérôme brought back
many curious memoranda of picturesque scenes, which he subsequently
converted into brilliant canvases. He excelled in reproducing
the caressing beauty of shimmering carpets and the rippling
sheen of silken textures.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<p>In the company of this experienced and reliable
guide, we wander from <cite>Jerusalem</cite> (1868)
to the <cite>Great Bath at Broussa</cite> (1885), from a <cite>Corner
of Cairo</cite> to <cite>Medinet</cite> and <cite>Fayoum</cite>. Here we
have the severed heads in the <cite>Mosque of El Hecanin</cite>,
the nude woman in the <cite>Moorish Bath</cite>, all the
barbarity and all the grace of the Orient,&mdash;and
invariably the anecdote, whether agreeable or
sinister, blends with the matchless splendour of
the landscape.</p>

<p>To this list must be added <cite>Recreation in Camp,
a Souvenir of Moldavia</cite> (Salon of 1854), in which
a soldier is dancing before his assembled comrades,
to the sound of drums, fifes, and violins.
A sentinel keeps watch. It is a picture taken in
the act, and intensely real.</p>

<p>It is easy to detect the historian, or, to adopt
the expression of M. Jules Claretie, the "Memoir
Maker," possessed of the true gift, agreeable and
individual, lurking behind every one of the works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of this authoritative orientalist. He dedicated
himself quite naturally and with great success to
the interpretation of history and of the historic
and literary anecdote.</p>

<p>His love of contrasts, his gift for depicting
locality and somehow conveying the very atmosphere
belonging to the varied scenes that are to
be brought before the spectator's eye, give amplitude
to such attractive little compositions as <cite>Louis
XIV. and Molière</cite> (1863), and <cite>A Collaboration</cite> (1874);
evoke the whole sombre tragedy of the death of
Maréchal Ney, <cite>December 7, 1815, Nine o'clock in
the Morning</cite> (1868); and appeal successively to
our curiosity, our sympathy, or our admiration,
with a Frederick II., conqueror of Silesia, playing
on his flute, the <cite>King Flutist</cite> (1874, purchased by
M. H. Oppenheim), <cite>His Gray Eminence</cite> (1874), in
which the austere and dominant Father Joseph is
making his way alone, down the stairway, in the
presence of the obsequious courtiers; a Bonaparte
day-dreaming before the Sphinx, <cite>Oedipus</cite> (1886), a
<cite>Bonaparte at Cairo</cite> gazing at the town from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
back of his Arab horse, a <cite>Bonaparte in Egypt</cite>,
mounted on a white dromedary, dreaming of his
omnipotence, of his conquest of the universe, and
surrounded by his overdriven soldiers.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Gérôme made a sort of
hero-worship of Napoleon and the Napoleonic
epic, resembling in this respect his friend, M.
Frédéric Masson, the celebrated historian of the
Emperor, who was better qualified than any other
writer to pay an eloquent tribute to this <cite>Bonaparte
in Egypt</cite>.</p>

<p>"Bonaparte is no longer on the road to Syria,
he is on the road to India; he is hesitating between
the two halves of the world that he holds
in his hands; he is weighing the destiny of Alexander
against the destiny of Cæsar; he is asking
himself whether Asia, to which he holds the
key, is a fair exchange for Europe which he has
just quitted; and while his dream embraces the
universe, he leaves his human rubbish heap to
suffer."</p>

<p>Gérôme is wholly himself when he has an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
anecdote to give us, whether it be subtle, humorous,
kindly, or dramatic, and even,&mdash;why not use
the word?&mdash;melodramatic.</p>

<p>Classified thus, <cite>The Duel after the Masquerade</cite>
fully deserves its brilliant reputation. Reproduced,
not only in lithographs and engravings,
but even transferred to the theatre (given at the
Gymnase, in 1881, by Mme. Fould), its subject
has become a matter of general knowledge. It is
winter in the Bois de Boulogne. A number of
people in fancy costume are bending over a
wounded Pierrot, while one of the witnesses of
this improvised duel is leading away the murderer,
the Harlequin.</p>

<p>One can see at once what a tremendous appeal
a subject like this would have for the general
public.</p>

<p>This singular drama, taking place in the snow,
all this joyousness ending in bloodshed and perhaps
death, is so fantastic that it leaves a lasting
impression. It was, by the way, as M. Guillaumin
has explained, suggested by an actual duel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
that took place between Deluns-Montaud, the
Harlequin, and the Prefect of Police Bortelle,
the Pierrot.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there was, and still is, ground
for criticism. Alexandre Dumas thought, not unreasonably,
that serious-minded men of that age
would not go out to fight each other in such a
costume. Edmond About criticized the pose of
Crispin supporting on his knee an entire group of
spectators, along with the body of poor Pierrot.
But Paul de Saint-Victor praised the "truthfulness
of the postures, the etching-like precision
of the heads, the wise planning of the whole
composition."</p>

<p>In order to appreciate better the daring fantasy
and the wise and invariably picturesque inventiveness
of Gérôme, we have only to study further
such works as the Frieze destined to be
reproduced upon a vase commemorative of the
Exposition of London (1853), <cite>Rembrandt Etching</cite>
(exhibited in 1867, purchased by M. E. Fould),
which has been admired for its golden half-shadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and freely compared to Gerard Dow, the
<cite>Reception of the Siamese Ambassadors</cite> (1865), <cite>The
First Kiss of the Sun</cite> (1886), the <cite>Poet</cite>, <cite>Thirst</cite> (1888),
and fantasies, such as, <cite>The Amateur of Tulips</cite>,
<cite>Whoever you are, here is your Master</cite>; anecdotal
portraits throwing side lights on history, such as:
<cite>They are Conspiring</cite>, or <cite>Not Convenient</cite>, <cite>Louis XI.
visiting Cardinal Balue</cite>, <cite>Promenade of the Court
in the Gardens of Versailles</cite> (1896); animals full of
life and prowess, such as: <cite>The Lioness meeting a
Jaguar</cite> and <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego nominor Leo</cite>, a lion rendered life
size; lastly, his studio interiors, in which he has
chosen to depict himself exactly as he was, that is
to say, a sincere, clear-sighted, and indefatigable
workman.</p>

<p>In the most recent of these studio pictures, he
appears, wearing a sculptor's blouse and occupied
in modelling a statuette of a woman. He astonished
his friends and admirers, during his last
years, by his earnest labours in sculpture. His
two groups, <cite>The Gladiators</cite> and <cite>Anacreon, Bacchus
and Cupid</cite>, claimed the attention of the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
at the Exposition of 1878; and it was the same
with his marble statue of <cite>Omphale</cite> (1887), his
<cite>Tanagra</cite>, his <cite>Dancing Girl</cite>, his bronze <cite>Lion</cite> (1890,
1891), etc.</p>

<p>His efforts to revive the art of coloured or
polychrome sculpture, the so-called chryselephantine
sculpture, which invokes the aid of various
precious elements, constitute one of the most
curious and important artistic experiments of
modern times, even though the result did not
always come up to the expectation.</p>

<p>On February 2, 1892, in an unpublished letter
addressed to M. Germain Bapst, who desired
information concerning the artist's experiment,
Gérôme wrote: "I have always been struck
with a sense of the coldness of statues if, when
the work is once finished, it is left in its natural
state. I have already made some experiments
and am continuing my efforts, for I am
anxious to bring before the eyes of the public
a few demonstrations that I hope will be conclusive.
I know that there are a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
protests. The world always protests against anything
which is, I will not merely say new, but
even renewed; for it disturbs a good many people
in their tranquillity and their routine." And after
having first shown that ancient architecture was
adorned with colours and that in chryselephantine
sculpture the Greeks combined gold, tin, and
ivory, that they painted the marble and united it
with various metals, Gérôme added: "Shall I
succeed? At least I shall have the honour of
having made the attempt."</p>

<p>In the interesting study which M. Germain
Bapst devoted to this question, after having, as
we have seen, consulted the artist himself, he
recalled the fact that both in chateaux and in
churches the Mediæval statuary was coloured.
In Greece, the Minerva Parthenos contained a
weight of gold equivalent to more than 2,200,000
francs in the French currency of to-day. The
statue of Jupiter at Olympus was partly of ivory
and partly of gold.</p>

  <p>(In a Private Collection, United States)</p>

<p class="block">In the mournful immensity of African solitudes, the king of
planets mounts towards the zenith, darting his fires upon the arid
land that he consumes, while the other king of the desert, the lion,
contemplates the triumphant ascension of his rival in the sky.
Gérôme has rendered the scene with an eloquence all the greater
because he has employed such simple means.</p></div>
</div>


<p>Towards the middle of the nineteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
the Duc de Luynes undertook, in collaboration
with the architect Dubau, to produce an example of
chryselephantine sculpture, which cost him more
than 500,000 francs and was placed on view at
the Exposition Universelle held in the Palais de
l'Industrie in 1855.</p>

<p>Gérôme in his turn made a like attempt, in
his <cite>Bellona</cite>, in which, to remedy the cold immobility
of the material, he coloured both the
ivory and the marble and at the same time invoked
the aid of silver, bronze, gold, and enamel.
He had associated with him several experienced
collaborators, such as M. Siot-Decauville, who
was to cast the face of Bellona in bronze, Messrs.
Moreau-Vauthier and Delacour to point the ivory,
M. Gautruche to attend to the verde-antique and
the electroplating. Lastly, Gallé, and M. Lalique
as well, made a number of trial models for the
little head of Medusa.</p>

<p>Among the other examples of Gérôme's sculpture,
mention must be made of <cite>The Entrance of
Bonaparte into Cairo</cite> (1897), <cite>Bonaparte</cite>, a bust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
(1897), <cite>Timour-Lang, the Lion Tamer</cite> (1898), <cite>Frederick

<h2 class="no-break"><a name="THE_ART_OF_GEROME" id="THE_ART_OF_GEROME">THE ART OF GÉRÔME</a></h2>


<p>"If you wish to be happy," Gérôme used to
say to his pupils, "remain students all your lives."
For his own part he applied himself ceaselessly to
his studies, trusting nothing to chance. He had
an extraordinarily methodical and orderly mind,
even in regard to the smallest details. It is related
that, when he was absent on his travels, he
would notify his models several months in advance,
so that they would be on hand to pose for
him in his studio, from the very day of his arrival.</p>

<p>Being partly a traditionalist and partly an independent,
he did not always possess the gift of
pleasing the critics, and he loved them none too
well. And when one of them asked him one day
for a sketch, he replied, "I do not pay to be applauded."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
But he was exceedingly strict in his
self-criticism. In one of his notes entrusted to his
relative Timbal, he wrote: "I am my own severest
critic&hellip;. I am under no delusion regarding
my works."</p>

<p>On the other hand, and it is well to dwell upon
this in order to grasp his personality, Gérôme was
far from being an eclectic. Of the work of Puvis
de Chavannes he said with virulence: "It won't
stand analysis, it is a series of mannikins set on
the ground all out of plumb, and nothing seems
to fit in." And he made a play upon words by
employing, in place of Puvis, the Latin word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulvis</i>, which signifies dust.</p>

<p>After his appointment as professor at the École
des Beaux-Arts, he did his best to have Manet
banished from it. He couched his protest in the
following energetic terms: "I am certain that
Manet was capable of painting good pictures.
But he chose to be the apostle of a decadent
fashion, the scrap-work school of art. I, for my
part, have been chosen by the State to teach the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
orthography of art to young students&hellip;. I do
not think it right to offer them as a model the
extremely arbitrary and sensational work of a
man who, although gifted with rare qualities, did
not develop them." In his opinion, it would have
been more suitable to exhibit such works in a
bar-room than at the Beaux-Arts. M. Coutil relates
that Gérôme said further on this same subject:
"The first merit a painting should have is to
be luminous and alluring in colour, and not dull
and obscure."</p>

<p>He had, for that matter, no more tolerance for
Millet than for Sisley, Monet, and Pissaro. On
one occasion, he assured M. Jules Claretie that if
Millet could return and again send his canvases
to the Salon, he would refuse them over again!
And, when his distinguished interlocutor protested,
"Oh, come now, Gérôme, you don't mean
that!" he declared unhesitatingly, "I mean just
that, and nothing else."</p>

<p>Messrs. Moreau-Vauthier and Dagnan-Bouveret
have given some very accurate and useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
details regarding his methods of instruction and
of work. They have shown him to us at his task,
both as painter and professor.</p>

<p>He emphasized the importance of construction,
and of the character of the form, rather than
the form itself, which is a matter of temperament.
He insisted that a scene must be visualized in its
completeness, as a harmonious and fully significant
whole. Emile Augier, for instance, with
whom he felt no annoyance at being compared,
the excellent comedian, Got, the younger Dumas,
Gounod,&mdash;all of these he loved for their absolute
clarity, and he demanded it of them. He declared
that one has no right to paint off-hand,
without a model; and he also held that one has
no right to make hasty, careless sketches.</p>

<p>His method was distinguished by its scrupulous
and admirable precision. Impeccable order
always reigned in his studio. M. Dagnan-Bouveret
writes that his palette and brushes were
scrupulously cared for. He used to overspread
his canvases with a uniform foundation of half-tones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
more or less warm or cold, using preparations
made by Troigras. He roughed in the
whole picture very rapidly, and this first rough
draft, according to connoisseurs, was always
extremely interesting.</p>

<p>In his paintings, he proved that the strength
of colouring is in inverse proportion to the intensity
of light. He had a marvellous faculty for
making the delicate shadings of nature correspond
with the psychological sentiments that their
aspects evoke. From this comes his amazing
variety.</p>

<p>A man of wide reading and deep culture,
Gérôme had a profound love for the truth, for
reality just as it is, holding that it is the artist's
first duty to know his place, his time, his episode,
and the one special angle of vision that will give
the rarest and most fruitful results.</p>

<p>On the eve of his death, he was still lauding
the merits of photography, which has the advantage
of being able to snatch a document straight
out of life, without falsifying it by giving it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
personal interpretation that must always be more
or less inaccurate.</p>

<p>Whatever allowance must be made for what
we may call the personal equation of an artist,
his own individual temperament, it is not unprofitable
to recall this opinion of Gérôme's, for
it helps us to acquire a better conception of his
art, based as it was upon accuracy and unwavering
truth.</p>

<p>Truth, which he once depicted in her well,
killed by liars and mountebanks (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mendacibus in
histrionibus occisa in puteo jacet alma Veritas</i>,
Salon of 1895), always charmed and inspired
him. He rendered it more attractive by his admirable
sincerity, by his chivalrous and imaginative
spirit, as well as by his archeological and
ethnographic learning.</p>

<p>Thanks to this lofty conscientiousness in research,
his work, erudite and entertaining at the
same time, making distant and vanished civilizations
live again, and reproducing atmospheres
and local settings with a delicacy that at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
is a trifle specious, but always incomparably picturesque,
cannot fail to please and charm to-day
as it did yesterday, and to-morrow as it does
to-day.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it is with good reason that M.
Soubies has lauded his fine attention to detail,
and that M. Thiebaut-Sisson has summed him
up in the following terms: "The artist created
his formula for himself. He extracted from it
the maximum effect that it contained." And
even while we glorify and venerate those painters
gifted with a graver or more lyric vision, a

most ingenious, the most brilliant &hellip; of his
generation."</p>
